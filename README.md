Certainly! Here's a detailed README.md for the "Socket_systematic_random_excel" project:
Socket_systematic_random_excel


Asynchronously send questions to a WebSocket server, read from an Excel file, and log responses.

This project uses AsyncIO and SocketIO to create an efficient question sender integrated with an Excel reader, allowing asynchronous query capabilities and response logging.

🚀 Features

Asynchronously send questions using AsyncIO and SocketIO.
Read questions from an Excel file using Pandas.
Log responses and errors using logging.
Calculate the total cost based on the number of requests.
